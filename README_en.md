## Project Overview:

Java patch file extraction and packaging refers to packaging modifications or updates to a Java application into a
single file for use when updates or fixes are needed. This process typically involves extracting modifications from an
existing Java application and packaging them into an executable patch file for updating or fixing existing programs.
This process is crucial to maintaining the proper functioning of an application, as it can address security
vulnerabilities, fix errors, and enhance functionality.
